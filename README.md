# Glitch in Time
Imagine this scenario: Life was normal until one day reality starts to glitch out and the spacetime continuum starts to rip apart. What would you do in this predicament? What could you do? What will even happen?
The answer to all of these questions? Nobody knows. However, YOU have been tasked to solve the issue before *it* happens.

# THE BIG R I P
In poor summary, the big rip is a hypothetical catastrophic cosmological event where all matter separates and atoms are eventually destroyed. It is also known as a possible end for the universe as we know it, where **everything** gradually is torn apart. 

# The End(?)
Maybe, just maybe, there's a way to save the universe... Or maybe the universe's fate is set in stone, who knows...
